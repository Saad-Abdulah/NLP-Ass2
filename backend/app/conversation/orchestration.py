"""
Prompt orchestration — guardrails, refusal pool, and RAG context injection.

Key changes over Ass 1:
- Expanded adversarial pattern set (coding, medical, Urdu, social-manipulation).
- 8-string varied refusal pool with per-session rotation (no repeated phrasing).
- RAG-driven context injection (build_inference_context) replaces static hints.
- is_adversarial_or_off_scope is the ONLY gate that bypasses the LLM; everything
  else goes to the LLM with appropriate context.
